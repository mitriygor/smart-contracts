# Collection of Smart Contracts


## 1. Token & ICO 

### Overview
This project consists of two Solidity smart contracts. The first contract, Mirtha, is an implementation of the ERC-20 Token Standard, and the second, MirthaICO, is for managing an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) for the Mirtha Token.

### Mirtha Token Contract
The Mirtha contract implements the ERC-20 standard, providing functionalities for token management, including transfers, balance inquiries, and allowances for third-party transfers.

### Key Features
- Token Information: The token is named "Mirtha" with the symbol "MRT" and does not support decimal values.
- Total Supply: Initially, 1,000,000 tokens are minted and assigned to the founder.
- Standard ERC-20 Functions: Includes transfer, balanceOf, approve, allowance, and transferFrom.

### Functions
- balanceOf: Returns the token balance of a specific address.
- transfer: Enables a token holder to transfer tokens to another address.
- allowance: Returns the remaining number of tokens that a spender is allowed to spend on behalf of the token owner.
- approve: Sets the amount a spender is allowed to withdraw from the owner's account.
- transferFrom: Allows a spender to transfer tokens from the ownerâ€™s account to another account.

### Mirtha ICO Contract
The MirthaICO contract is designed to manage the token sale process, including investment, token distribution, and emergency halting functionality.

### Key Features
- ICO Parameters: Customizable parameters like token price, hard cap, sale duration, and investment limits.
- State Management: Manages different states of the ICO (before start, running, after end, halted).
- Investment Function: Allows investors to send Ether to the contract in exchange for tokens.

### Functions
- invest: Handles the investment process, transferring tokens to investors based on the amount of Ether sent.
halt and resume: Allow the admin to halt or resume the ICO in case of emergencies.
- changeDepositAddress: Enables changing the address where collected funds are deposited.
- getCurrentState: Returns the current state of the ICO.
- burn: Allows burning of unsold tokens after the ICO ends.
- transfer and transferFrom (Overridden): Restrict token transfers until the end of the token trade period.

### Interacting with the Contract
- Deployment: Deploy the MirthaICO contract with a specified deposit address.
- Investing in the ICO: Send Ether to the contract address within the investment limits during the sale period.
- Token Transfer: Token holders can transfer their tokens after the token trade start time.
- Refund and Unsold Tokens: Investors can claim refunds under certain conditions, and unsold tokens can be burned after the ICO.

## 3. Auction

### Overview
This Solidity smart contract implements a blockchain-based auction system, designed to run on the Ethereum network. The contract allows participants to place bids during a predefined auction period, with the highest bidder at the end winning the auction.

### Features
- Ethereum-based Auction System: Runs on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring transparency and security.
- Configurable Auction Period: The auction duration is defined by start and end block numbers.
- Bid Management: Tracks each participant's bids and updates the highest bid in real time.
- Owner Privileges: The owner (deployer of the contract) can cancel the auction and finalize it.
- IPFS Integration: Supports storing auction data off-chain using IPFS.
